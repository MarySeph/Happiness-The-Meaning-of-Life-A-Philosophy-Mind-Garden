# Psychological Happiness

Putting it in other words, psychological happiness states that happiness is a mental state which can be achieved by manipulating the mind. I'm ignorant of the details so I'll skip to the main content.

In this area, [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] has extensively written about the autotelic experience he calls [[Flow]], having penned a book under the same name. In my own words, Flow is the middle point between a challenging and a mundane task. It's not hard nor easy enough that one becomes frustrated by it's difficulty nor tediousness. Flow experiences are commonly associated with artistic and creative endeavors such as playing an instrument, writing, or painting. If one has enough knowledge and experience in the craft, one can become so immersed in it that they lose perception of time and place. Their self-perception is reduced to the movements that engages them with the art. These experiences aren't limited to actions. They can also include seemly passive activities like listening to music. Flow experiences deserve an inclusive list!

[[Daniel Gilbert]]'s [[Stumbling on Happiness]] deserves a through read and discussion. The chapters read were [In the Blind Spot of the Mind's eye](obsidian://open?vault=Happiness%20%26%20The%20Meaning%20of%20Life%2C%20A%20Philosophy%20Mind%20Garden&file=Cards%2FDiscussion%20Notes%2FDiscussion%20of%20Gilbert's_In%20the%20Blind%20Spot%20of%20the%20Mind's%20Eye), [Paradise Glossed and Immune to Reality](obsidian://open?vault=Happiness%20%26%20The%20Meaning%20of%20Life%2C%20A%20Philosophy%20Mind%20Garden&file=Cards%2FDiscussion%20Notes%2FDiscussion%20of%20Gilbert's_Paradise%20Glossed%20and%20Immune%20to%20Reality). The book extensively discusses cognitive biases and the ways people's perceptions, judgements, and memories are a severely distorted reality. "In the Blind Spot of the Mind's Eye" that there are falsehoods in a person's recollections of past events which they use to inform their future actions. I would love to go into a ramble about the narratives people create about their lives and how their past gets reconstructed to suit unconscious or semi-conscious needs. On the other hand, "paradise Glossed" focuses on the human brain's tendency to take advantage of the ambiguous nature of experience and interpret it in a way that benefits the person. In opposition, there is also a tendency for people to seek knowledge to validate and protect their beliefs. Fascinating stuff could be discussed. Social circles, internet bubbles, confirmation bias, political polarization, and so many other things these concepts can be applied to by virtue of having lived our lives. Alas, potential is what I'll leave you with.

To end this section, theories of psychological happiness can be classified into [[Hedonism Theory of Happiness]], [[Emotional State]], [[Life Satisfaction]], and the many hybrid theories that combine two or more.
