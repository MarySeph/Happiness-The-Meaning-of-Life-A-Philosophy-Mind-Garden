# Reflection Papers

 The purpose of the papers was to practice the most important tools in philosophical thinking, **building clear arguments and addressing possible counterarguments**.

When evaluating philosophical arguments, there are two qualities being examined, [[Validity]] and [[Soundness]]. The former addresses the argument's internal logic while the latter its authenticity against the real world. As one might expect, soundness is harder to prove and easier to object to than validity, for there are various positions based on different worldviews and multiple contrasting views can be true.

The course opened with a reading of [[Nicomacean Ethics]], focusing on [[Aristoteles]]'s [[The Function Argument]] about "the good life" ([[Eudaimonia (εὐδαιμονία)]]). This was the topic of the [[DRAFT_IDH3600 - 1st Reflection Paper|IDH3600 - 1stReflectionPaper]]. The [[DRAFT_IDH3600 - 2nd Reflection Paper|IDH3600 - 2ndReflectionPaper]] was on [[Robert Nozick]]'s [[Traces]]. In these papers, we had to explain the author's argument, pose an objection, and evaluate it. The [[DRAFT_IDH3600 - 3rd Reflection Paper|IDH3600 - 3rdReflectionPaper]] removed the presence of an author, instead letting us choose among the leading theories, explain it, pose an objection, and evaluate it. Compared to the previous papers, it was as if we had no single author to rely on. Training wheels off. Lastly, up to the presentation of this database, the [[DRAFT_IDH3600 - 4th Reflection Paper|IDH3600 - 4thReflectionPaper]] hasn't been completed. The file is a placeholder.
