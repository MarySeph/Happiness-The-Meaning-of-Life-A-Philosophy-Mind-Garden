# The Point in Life

"Point" is akin to worth, or value. Things with a point are worthy or valuable. This quality gives them meaning. You can also think of this as the perspective which considers the **ultimate objective** of human life.

While there are author's that consider the point of life through the lenses of "humanity" or the "human race," due to time constraints, I will solely focus on the point in "individual" human lives. I'm honestly making a disservice sharing a single point of view, for there's truly fascinating thoughts from other authors on both the point of individual lives and the human race.

[[Richard Taylor]], using [[Albert Camus]]' [[Myth of Sisyphus]], claims that the point of our lives is found within us. *We* give meaning to our lives. This theory makes meaning (point) exclusively psychological and individual. This theory is called the[[Fulfillment View]].
