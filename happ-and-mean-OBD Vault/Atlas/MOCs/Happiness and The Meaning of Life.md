# Happiness and The Meaning of Life

Something worth mentioning about the intersection between happiness and the meaning of life is historical sensitivity, for before the Enlightenment, religion had a vast influence on many populations, contrary to today's general agnostic socio-cultural alignment. Mostly because the Church had a lot of political power. Anyways, back to topic! 

In the past, pious and god-fearing peasant and aristocratic lives alike, people's lives had meaning because there was a higher who cared. The narrative was anthropocentric. Human were chosen by God. They were special. Their importance was established. Unshakable. Most importantly, it gave meaning to their suffering. 

One of the most interesting findings I had in this class was the ripple effect of "killing God," as Nietzsche put it in the Gay Science. Never before has humanity depended on itself to forge its own path, and I cannot express how absolutely terrifying a realization that was. The weight of every choice was crushing, and there was no guide to light the path. There was no right and wrong. There were no absolutes. As a god-killer, it was like being sentenced to drift through a desert like an exile from a home I never truly belonged to. My existence began in the post-Enlightenment era the separation of church and state was an undisputed reality. At the same time, the country I lived during my formative years had a strong Christian background in both language and culture.

I found fault in the Christian moral doctrine and practice, labeling it rigid and restrictive. At worst, I considered those who upheld such doctrine as their personal moral compass to lack moral independence. At best, I understood critical thinking on moral matters is second to peace of mind in other matters like money and family. See Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. This course was an opportunity to think deeply about this issue on religion and morality. I find that [Tolstoy's My Confession](obsidian://open?vault=Happiness%20%26%20The%20Meaning%20of%20Life%2C%20A%20Philosophy%20Mind%20Garden&file=Cards%2FDiscussion%20Notes%2FTolstoy%20Discussion%20Notes) eloquently discusses this topic. In another work of his, Anna Karenina, his self-insert character also has this internal battle.

In a non-religious perspective, [[Susan Wolf]] intersects [[Happiness]] and the [[Meaning of Life]] in what she calls the [[Fitting Fulfillment View]]. It mergers [[Richard Taylor]]'s [[Fulfillment View]] which focuses on what one finds meaningful with her own view that takes into account what's objectively meaningful.

I believe Wolf's perspective is pretty mainstream. As a youth in what's known as the Third World or, as I have been hearing now, the Global South, when I was engaged with the topic of "my future" by adults or teachers, many shared the view that people should find their passion and pursue it. This passion of course, had to be meaningful in the grand scale of things. As a collective culture, it made sense for people to say that. Following that perspective, and learning about the tragedy of anthropocentric climate change, I decided to pursue a career in Environmental Science in the hopes to make people's lives a little bit better.
