# Happiness

What is happiness? For philosophers, such a question that would otherwise be answered to introduce a topic would be concise and simple. There is not such thing here. So while I will not tell you the definition of happiness, I will share what philosophers since Ancient Greece till now have written about the topic.

There are two significant notions about this thing called happiness. One has a physical component, known as [[Well-being]] and the other simply called [[Psychological Happiness]]. That's pretty much it.

[[Happiness and The Meaning of Life]], in this case the [[Meaning of Life]] tend to intersect every so often. This connection occurs more often in [[Psychological Happiness]] theories were the proposed notion happiness rests on a "meaningful meaning of one's life or the human species", a can which holds a bunch of worms as you'll quickly see.
