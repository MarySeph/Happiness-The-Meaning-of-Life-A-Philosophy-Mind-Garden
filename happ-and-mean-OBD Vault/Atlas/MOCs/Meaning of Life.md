# Meaning of Life

Ido Landau writes that philosophers, when writing about the meaning of life, they focus on the *worth, value, or the point* **in** life, or the *reason, or purpose* **of** life.

The former can be said to be goal-oriented while the latter theory-centered. As questions, the former can be written as "what am living *for*?" and the latter, "*why* am I alive?" 

I have decided to label as [[The Point in Life]] and the [[The Purpose of Life]] respectively.
