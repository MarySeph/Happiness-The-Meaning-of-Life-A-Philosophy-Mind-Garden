# Hedonism Theory of Happiness

---

Theory of [[Psychological Happiness]]. Claims that happiness can be obtained through the balance of the sensations of pleasure and pain. Differs from [[Hedonism Theory of Well-Being]] as it doesn't aim to push hedonism as a social good, nor does it claim hedonism itself as the only important factor in achieving happiness.
