# Discussion of Csikszentmihalyi

## Do you agree with any of Csikszentmihalyi's points? Do you disagree with any? Which ones and why?

I agree with the existence of flow as I have experienced it countless times whether it is writing or doing anything creative. I also agree that those kinds of experiences, their complexity, are much more satisfying in the long-run compared to endeavors like the accumulation of wealth. Being up to the task of what is demanded of one is comforting, although I believe the struggle of learning and developing skills is just as important. Perhaps being ill-fitted aka not having the knowledge, skills, or time to fulfill a task to a standard is a frustrating experience.
