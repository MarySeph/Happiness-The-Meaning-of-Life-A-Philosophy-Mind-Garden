# Tolstoy Discussion Notes

## Prompt: Please paste or note the passage and write down any notes you have for discussion. Your notes can be just a few key words, and needn't be a full paragraph.

"Their faith was necessary for them, and that it alone gave them a meaning and possibility of life."

Having lived in a country with a high rate of material poverty and low industrialization, despite the church and state being separate and being independent from colonial powers of previous centuries, the grip of religious faith is strong. 

In Ecuador, science and religion have managed to find common ground. Science and Faith have made amends and live in the heads of both wise and common people. All I can share is personal anecdotes, I have not studied this topic in any objective way. I think that Faith gives the common people hope and meaning in their lives. I have witnessed it in the faces of labor workers, people from small towns, and immigrants. Arguing them about it seems like an act of violence, why should I take away something that is so central to their life? That which helps them look forward to the sunrise and face another back-breaking day? For as much as I have read about the spread of the Christian faith in colonized territories, it is also true that people at their weakest need something to hold onto. It cannot be separated from the culture by force. Faith is an amoral concept and act that many people have used to justify acts of harm, religious or otherwise. Thus, something that I ask myself concerning relations with Native peoples and descendants of the colonies is how to make amends? How to foster forgiveness? And how does a society in which groups with different cultural and religious backgrounds can coexist?

The idiosyncrasies of Native peoples in the American continent interest me deeply. I believe that some have a similar answer to the meaning of life which Tolstoy refers to as "the relation of the finite to the infinite." Tolstoy described Christian Catholic and Orthodox religions answers. The alternative which I want to learn more of is one where death isn't a definite end but that which unifies all living things. Human life goes from "phantasmal and destructible" to "infinite." I believe there is a place for science under this worldview for it is a tool to gather information. In particular, the discipline of Ecology strongly supports such a view of a single, unified whole called life in this Earth.
