# Landau Discussion Notes

## Prompt: Note the passage and write down any notes you have for discussion. Your notes can be just a few key words, and needn't be a full paragraph.
"Today science is taken to be neither precise, nor certain, nor necessary, nor objective." pg265.

This argument is something that has garnered my interest. Philosophically, it can be argued through epistemological skepticism that because nothing can be truly perceived, conclusions of scientific endeavors are of not use. And science is not about proving stuff but of gathering information. "agreement between scientists" is the closest thing to "truth." However, science is a community effort, built upon generations of human beings. Scientific "truths" of the past such as phrenology or the humors were still acted upon by people during that time. It's the best they had. Likewise, the same could be said with some "truths" now. They are informed by the amount of available evidence. Some postulates, such as anthropogenic-induced global warming have a lot of evidence from many decades to back it up while others not as much. Perhaps there is a factor of miscommunication between scientists and the media and the public that establishes facts that inform actions. Because science *is* used to inform actions. Politics, economics, social, scientific endeavors has an effect on everyday lives. I do not know where I'm going with this. Perhaps the question I want to address is, should science, if it is a credible source of information, inform human actions regardless of the amount of information available about a topic or situation? The accurate and precision of scientific data is perhaps my greatest concern which the discipline of Epistemology can call into doubt. Furthermore, how should scientists and non-scientist tackle the flaws in scientific publishing which can be manipulated through connections and financial decisions instead of ethics and the public good.
