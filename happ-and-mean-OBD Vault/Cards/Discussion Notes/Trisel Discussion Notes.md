# Trisel Discussion Notes

## Prompt: What is one point Trisel makes that you agree with or disagree particularly strongly? Why do you agree or disagree?

I agree with Trisel's rejection of long-lastingness, whether personal, or as a species, to give meaning to our lives. He talks about this is "Life Without Future Generations" (pg. 375). The meaning of life to certain people doesn't have to be goal-oriented; it doesn't have to have an end. It can be something to do throughout their life, like "being kind to my human and other-than-human neighbors" or "raise a child." Meanings like these have no end. They are vague enough to give one's life direction, a reason to get up in the morning and face life. I am of the mind that considering humanity's or the solar system's eventual end and affecting one's notion of the meaning of their lives is a little silly, for it will happen WAY after one's life has ended. It seems impractical. We have the opportunity to affect this world for so many years. The real question to me is, how are we going to spend the time we have in this world?
