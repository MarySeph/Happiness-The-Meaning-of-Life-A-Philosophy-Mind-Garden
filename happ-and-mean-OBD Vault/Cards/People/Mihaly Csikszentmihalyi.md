# Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

> [!QUOTE]
> Csikszentmihalyi was noted for his work in the study ofÂ [happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness "Happiness")Â andÂ [creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity "Creativity"), but is best known as the architect of the notion ofÂ  [[Flow]]Â and for his years of research and writing on the topic. [Martin Seligman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman "Martin Seligman"), former president of theÂ [American Psychological Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association "American Psychological Association"), described Csikszentmihalyi as the world's leading researcher onÂ [positive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology "Positive psychology").Â Csikszentmihalyi onceÂ said: "Repression is not the way to virtue. When people restrain themselves out of fear, their lives are by necessity diminished. Only through freely chosen discipline can life be enjoyed and still kept within the bounds of reason." His works are influential and are widely cited. â€” Wikipedia
