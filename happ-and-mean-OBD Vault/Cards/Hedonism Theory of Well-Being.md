Theory of [[Well-being]]. Claims that happiness can be obtained through the balance of the sensations of pleasure and pain. [[Utilitarianism]] in particular differs from the [[Hedonism Theory of Happiness]] as hedonism is considered to be a social good and claims it to be the sole measure of well-being.
