# Arguments For and Against Subjective and Objective Views on Value

Pitui, pitui. Here's a list of ideas to build arguments on subjective and objectives views of value.

First, some definitions.

**Subjective Value.-** "a thing's good is dependent solely on what a(n) agent(s) think about it." Includes intersubjectivity.

**Objective value.-** Good is dictated by something other than a(n) agent.

| Subjective | Objective |
|:---|:---|
| Nuance | Essentials for living (food) |
| Adaptability | Too negative to allow (murder) |
| Growth mindset | Value can be found across species (empathy, love, care) |
| Who is the judge of objective value? | Unifying factor of human cultures across time and space (beauty, health, etc) |
