# IDH3600 - Happiness & The Meaning of Life - 1st Reflection Paper - Paragraph 1

#### Introductory Paragraph

Hope is the fuel of the human spirit. Hope for a better future, hope for a better life. However, what is the form of the dream behind the desire for positive change that drives human migration and social revolutions? The roots of this ideal, as many others, are found in Ancient times. In the Western world, much of that influence stems from Ancient Greece and its colorful cast of thinkers. Among them, Aristoteles thought and wrote extensively on the subject.

#### Thesis

Aristoteles, in his seminal work Nicomacean Ethics, proposes that the highest good (summun bonum) consists in a good life (eudaimonia) which is the end of all human endeavor. He argues that a good life can be achieved by performing virtuous actions across a lifetime. This moral philosophy is known as Virtue Theory.


####  Topic Sentence I. On the Goals of the Ends
##### Main Point
Aristoteles begins by considering the purpose of human activities. 

###### Support
He states that actions are undertaken for a goal. For example, people work to have enough money to pay for essentials and so on. In other words, there is a sequence of goals that guide human actions. Therefore, there is an ultimate goal that guides all human actions (Aristoteles, 2011).

#### Topic Sentence II. On the Highest Good
##### Main Point
Seeking the essence of this ultimate goal, or highest good, Aristoteles turns to his peers. There is a uniform agreement that a good life, eudaimonia, is such (Aristoteles, 2011).
###### Support
Eudaimonia, the good life, for Aristoteles, satisfies three conditions for the highest good. One, a good life is desired for its own sake; the end is itself. Two, all other things are desired for its sake; there are ends that come before it. Three, It's not desired for the sake of something else; there is no other end that follows. With this revelation, Aristoteles follows to discuss the good life.


#### Topic Sentence III. The Function Argument
##### Main Point
Aristoteles believes that a good life consists in performing one's function virtuously across a lifetime. 

###### Support
He asserts that the function of a human is to reason, and it has to be done virtuously so that it informs the actions throughout one's life. This implies that, happiness is achieved after death if others conclude so (Aristoteles, 2011). Formed as an argument, Aristoteles says that "If the highest good(x) leads to a good life(y), and performing one's function(z) is the highest good(x), then performing one's function(z) leads to a good life(y)." The rest of the books builds the moral theory based on the concept of virtue. Virtue is the Golden Mean between extremes of deficiency and excess. Aristoteles states that the virtuous action between the extremes can be discovered through reason.
