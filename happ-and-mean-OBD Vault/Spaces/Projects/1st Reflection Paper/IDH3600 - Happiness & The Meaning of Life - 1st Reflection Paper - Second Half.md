# IDH3600 - Happiness & The Meaning of Life - 1st Reflection Paper - Second Half

#### Thesis
Aristoteles' Function Argument **limits the value of human life to the capacity to perform a specific function.** In this second half, I propose one objection and propose an alternative way to achieve a good life.

####  Topic Sentence I. Objection to The Function Argument
While I support the intent behind the conclusion--that reasoning ought to inform our actions, I do not consider reasoning to be the function of a human in which their moral value rests.

##### Main Point
Arguing that the value of a shoemaker rests on the quality of their products diminishes their life.

###### Support 1.
Work doesn't give value to people. People ought to neither live for work, not work to live. Furthermore, this argument makes "a good life" unavailable to a great deal of people, in particular those with few financial resources. This perspective encourages a thoughts of deficiency and elevates material greed.

#### Topic Sentence II. Personal Thoughts on A Good Life
##### Main Point
Thus, I propose that a good life is both an achievable and sustainable goal. 

###### Support 1.
A good life ought to take into account the community. In addition, it cannot be a psychological state, for people are prone to errors in judgement. Through Utilitarianism--a moral theory that aims to bring the greatest amount of good to the greatest number of people (Crash Course, 2017)--a good life become an objective judgement that values interpersonal relationships, non-material well-being, and the pleasure and pain of those involved.

Thus, a good life could be one of harmonious relations where people care about each other's well-being and are an active participants in the health of oneself, others, and the community. This can also extend to the well-being of other-than-human members such as pets and local wildlife, and even non-sentient beings like infrastructure.
