# IDH3600 - Happiness & The Meaning of Life - 3rd Reflection Paper - Paragraph 3

The Paradox of Hedonism reveals that pleasure is an indirect result of unrelated events, however, pleasure is not the only element in the hedonist theory. If the paradox is correct, it has no bearing in the intent behind the hedonist theory to *balance* pleasure and pain. At most, it shows that pleasure is *impossible* to obtain intentionally, but that is just a single lane that has been closed, not the whole road. To put it simply, the methods behind the quest for pleasure and their respective success are unrelated to efforts to balance pleasure and pain. For example, a professional biker falls over and scrapes their leg. The wound burns. The next logical step would be to apply first aid to the wound as soon as possible. However, even if the wound has been nursed, it may still hurt. In hedonist terms, the biker took measures to reduce pain through applying first aid. While pleasure was neither sought nor obtained, pain was diminished but not wholly removed. Thus, while pleasure was neither a direct not indirect result, the effort to control the pain is good for that person.
