This is the homepage for the Spring 2024 course, IDH3600 - Happiness and The Meaning of Life digital garden. An online version of this garden might be available [here](https://maryseph.github.io/Happiness-The-Meaning-of-Life-A-Philosophy-Mind-Garden/) if the author had time to prepare one outside of Obsidian. Think of it like Wikipedia. There is no traced path. You are free to explore between the pages at your leisure.

To begin exploring the main topics of this course, go to [[Happiness]] or [[Meaning of Life]]. For a discussion on the intersection between the two, go to [[Happiness and The Meaning of Life]]

## About the Course
We examined various key philosophical writings on [[Happiness]] and the [[Meaning of Life]]. Course assignments ranged from notes from **readings**, **class discussions**, and **four reflection papers**. [[Discussion Notes]] on the readings for a given class were due the night before so that class discussions function as a place to clarify understanding, or share thoughts and ideas. Each [reflection paper](obsidian://open?vault=Happiness%20%26%20The%20Meaning%20of%20Life%2C%20A%20Philosophy%20Mind%20Garden&file=Reflection%20Papers) focused on a different author or view recently addressed in class.
