# Wolf Discussion Notes

## Prompt: What is one passage from Wolf's piece that you find particularly interesting, troublesome, touching, or otherwise remarkable? Paste the passage here and offer a brief comment about what you find in it.

"We have at least much reason to recognize the legitimacy of agents' reasons to pursue the realization of values whose sources lies outside of the agents themselves as we have to recognize the legitimate pursue of the agents' own well-being." (pg.54; Meaning and Morality)

This passage in from a section that discusses meaning and morality. The main idea I got from it is that morality cannot be the absolute standard in which people ought to live by. In other words, between meaningful lives or moral lives, people would incline towards the former. She also argues that morality should take into account people's interests and goals.
