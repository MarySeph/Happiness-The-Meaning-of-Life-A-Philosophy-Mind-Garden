# Discussion of Nozick

## Prompt: Pose one objection or challenge to one of Nozick's arguments.

I would argue against the role of humans in God's Plan being central or having any degree of importance. I think it would be interesting to explore other narratives and examine anthropocentric ones that put humans above other-than-human beings.
