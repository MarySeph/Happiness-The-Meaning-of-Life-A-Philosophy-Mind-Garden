# Discussion of Flanagan et al.

## Please select a passage from "Against Happiness" for us to discuss in class and prepare a comment on it for in-class discussion.
"For researchers to assume a particular theory of happiness or well-being  
without acknowledging that they are taking a stand on contested  
matters is not best practice, especially when addressing nonexperts who aren’t aware of the controversies and may thus be misled about what the evidence shows."

I chose this passage because it states that there are a lot of controversies about happiness and well-being among experts (ex. philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, etc) which are important to communicate to non-experts (ex. policymakers, the public, etc). It is important because giving the impression that there is a single or a right theory of well-being is misleading and may have negative consequences. It is also disinformation and I can't support for that.
