# Discussion of Gilbert's_Paradise Glossed and Immune to Reality

## Please select a passage from Gilbert's "Paradise Glossed" or "Immune to Reality" for us to discuss in class and prepare a comment on it for in-class discussion.
If heartbreaks and calamities can be blessings in disguise, then why are their disguises so convincing? The answer is that the human mind tends  
to exploit ambiguity."

Continuing on the theme of the human mind being fickle and easily tricked, this reading focuses on how ambiguity, both situational and contextual can serve different purposes which a person knows none. To experiencing the bliss of ignorance or the boredom of knowledge, even seemly, is but a trick of the mind. People are ignorant, but many also have a strong thirst for knowledge. Quenching that thirst through the acquisition of knowledge is either temporal or misguided for people cannot learn the state of the world and any piece of knowledge brings a thousand more questions. It is an eternal endeavor which the span of a single human life cannot achieve.
