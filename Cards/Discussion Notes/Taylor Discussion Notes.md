# Taylor Discussion Notes

## Prompt: Pose one of objection or challenge to one of Taylor's arguments.

Taylor seems to be saying that people's efforts, while lacking meaning in the grand scheme of things, they are meaningful to our psychology. That is, to prevent or avoid boredom.

I object in the grounds that human motivation may have other roots apart from avoidance of that pain of boredom. It could be goodwill.
