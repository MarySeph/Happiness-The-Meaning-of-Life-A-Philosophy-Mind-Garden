# St. Thomas Aquinas Discussion Notes

## Prompt: What salient similarities do you see between Thomas Aquinas' ideas on happiness and Aristotle's? What salient differences do you see?

## Pre-reading
I believe that Aquina's postulate on happiness parts from Aristoteles'. From the headline of each article, I surmise that Aquinas, because of his Christian perspective, might argue that happiness lies in following God's plan and seeking His favor. That happiness can be achieved in this life through God and that every man desires happiness because every man seeks God's favor. Finally, there is no end to human life because life is eternal. The only difference is that after a person dies, they go to Heaven of Hell and live in eternal bliss or torment for the rest of eternity.

## Post-reading
Aquinas disagrees that human actions are deliberate and that they are not born from an end. Firstly, because of reactionary actions. Secondly, because the end, which has not been achieved, is a perceived end, or and imaginary one. Thus, the end in which human act for does not exist.

Furthermore, he insists that happiness equates to pleasure, for there is no other reason to seek pleasure than to be happy; human reason and will is attracted to pleasure; pleasure is good because all desire it and good things can be desired.

Lastly, he argues that humans can attain imperfect happiness through "knowing and loving God." However, he also states that not everyone desires happiness because they may not be able to perceive the "Divine Essence" and people want things they cannot have yet continue to yearn, choosing to be miserable over gratitude for what they already have.
