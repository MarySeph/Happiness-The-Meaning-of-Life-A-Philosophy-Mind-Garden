# Discussion of Gilbert's_In the Blind Spot of the Mind's Eye

## Please select a passage from Gilbert's "In the Blind Spot of the Mind's Eye for us to discuss in class and prepare a comment on it for in-class discussion.

"your mistake was in unthinkingly treating what you imagined as though it were an accurate representation of the facts."

I think this phrase sums up Gilbert's argument in this chapter. To expand on it, Gilbert is dissecting the experience of using past experiences to inform decisions about the future by honing into results from various experiments where people's current perceptions of a past event are completely different from the actual experience and initial judgements. This is the blind spot of the mind's eye. There is something lacking when we perceive the world, a blind spot, and we incorrectly assume that such faulty judgement holds any sort of truth. I find that this argument of isn't ground-breaking for I find that it holds relation to the philosophy of Stoicism. I have also been thinking about the concept of narratives and how in my own life and those of others narrate past events and how as time passes, the narrative changes. Without putting pen into paper, the story of our lives can be told in so many different ways and without evidence, there is no way to examine them nor to conclude that one is more accurate than another. In relation to happiness, if Gilbert's argument is true and our perceptions of the world are inaccurate, then how is any endeavors to achieve happiness be anything but misguided?
