> [!QUOTE]
> He is best known for his bookÂ _[Anarchy, State, and Utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy,_State,_and_Utopia "Anarchy, State, and Utopia")_Â (1974), aÂ [libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism "Libertarianism")Â answer toÂ [John Rawls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls "John Rawls")'Â _[A Theory of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice "A Theory of Justice")_Â (1971), in which Nozick proposes hisÂ [minimal state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_state#Philosophy "Minimal state")Â as the only justifiable form of government. His later work,Â _[Philosophical Explanations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Explanations "Philosophical Explanations")_Â (1981), advanced notable epistemological claims, namely his counterfactual theory of knowledge. It won theÂ [Phi Beta Kappa Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa_Society "Phi Beta Kappa Society")'sÂ [Ralph Waldo Emerson Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_award "Ralph Waldo Emerson award")Â the following year.

His final work before his death,Â _[Invariances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariances "Invariances")_Â (2001), introduced his theory of evolutionaryÂ [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), by which he argues invariances, and hence objectivity itself, emerged through evolution acrossÂ [possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_worlds "Possible worlds"). â€” Wikipedia
