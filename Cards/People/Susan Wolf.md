> [!QUOTE] 
> Wolf's work centres on the relation between freedom, morality, happiness and meaningfulness in life. Her book _Freedom Within Reason_ (Oxford, 1990) argues for a view of [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will") as the [ability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ability "Ability") to do what one reasonably thinks is the right thing. This allows a [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism") universe to nevertheless contain responsibility and the feeling of autonomy for us. Wolf has also written on the topic of [moral luck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_luck "Moral luck"), suggesting a reconciliation between the rationalist and irrationalist positions. She has also published influential work on the demandingness of morality. In this area her paper "Moral Saints" has been particularly influential, attacking the idea that a morally perfect person is actually an attractive ethical ideal. Along with [Philippa Foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Foot "Philippa Foot") and [Bernard Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Williams "Bernard Williams"), she has challenged the overriding of morality in practical reasoning.

> Wolf has also written extensively on the meaning in human life. She addresses the topic of the meaning of life in her essay: “Happiness and Meaning: Two Aspects of the Good Life”, in which she summaries her view as "Meaning arises when subjective attraction meets objective attractiveness… meaning arises when a subject discovers or develops an affinity for one or typically several of the more worthwhile things…". In other words, living a meaningful life consists of one's active engagement with objectively worthwhile things. — Wikipedia
