</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In roughly the first half of the paper, you should:
<ul>
<li><strong>Explain the argument Nozick is arguing against.</strong></li>
<li>Explain Nozick's objections to that argument, and how that objection works.</li>
<li>Explain a further argument Nozick makes.
<ul>
<li>You should include some textual evidence (in the form of quotations), and also explanations in your own words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In roughly the second half of the paper, you should:
<ul>
<li>Evaluate Nozick's argument(s)—Pose an objection, explain how that objection works; if space allows, say whether and how that objection fails or succeeds. Can Nozick respond?</li>
<li>Tell me what you personally think and why—Do you agree with Nozick? Why or why not?</li>

</p>
<h4>Introductory Paragraph</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>(establish the topic so the reader knows enough to follow the paper.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Ever-lasting", "immortalizing", "larger than life", these words evoke a feeling of grandiose. A romantic struggle to rise above the fragility and temporality of human existence to achieve something close to god(dess)hood. The narrative of rising above one's limitations is coated with admiration, hope, and other virtues. At its core it's the promise of immortality, at least among our peers, but a possibility of extending life longer than it's inevitable end nevertheless. Where did this value judgement originate, and what are its downsides?
</p>
<h4>Thesis</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>topic + claim (if you have one) + one point for each body paragraph
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this paper, I will <strong>explain the origin of the idea of the superiority of permanence, describe Nozick's objections against this idea, evaluate his argument, and offer my opinion on Nozick's argument.</strong>
</p>
<h4>Body</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>(three paragraphs) (Start each with a topic sentence that summarizes the main idea.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Topic Sentence I. Permanence as a Quality of a Meaningful Life</h5>
<h6>Main Point</h6>
<p>The superiority of permanence dates back to Ancient Greece. Plato famously argued for entities called Forms which are eternal and unchanging (2022, Kraut).
</p>
<h6>Support 1.</h6>
<p>These Forms were deemed superior to concrete objects because the latter eventually crumble into dust. Forms are another word for ideas, both concrete and abstract, such as a chair, Justice, Love, an apple, and so forth. These forms are immaterial which renders them indestructible. Because of this seemly immortal quality, they are superior to objects that can be sensed, death comes for all living things but the transmission of ideas and beliefs across generations keeps them alive. Since then, this value judgement has been applied to human existence, morphing into the belief that a meaningful life is one that leaves a significant trace in the world.
</p>
<h5>Topic Sentence II. Against Permanence (1)</h5>
<h6>Main Point</h6>
<p>In the article "Philosophy and the Meaning of Life," Robert Nozick critiques this value judgement.
</p>
<h6>Support 1.</h6>
<p>He hones into what entails to being eternal, becoming an idea; an abstract, unchangeable existence (2010, Benatar). Nozick believes this isn't the trace people want to leave. A trace that reflects the positive qualities of the individual which is tied to something they cared deeply about (2010, Benatar). For Nozick, becoming an idea means taking a snapshot of a person's life and freeze it for all eternity.
</p>
<h5>Topic Sentence III. Against Permanence (2)</h5>
<h6>Main Point</h6>
<p>One way Nozick develops his objection is by critiquing funeral services.
</p>
<h6>Support 1.</h6>
<p>Specifically, he argues about tombstones and funeral orators. On the former, he describes tombstones are memorials that prevent people from being forgotten. A marked tombstone indicates the life that is not more, an objective symbol of that person's existence. Until that tombstone breaks, crumbles, or becomes illegible, the person's existence can be acknowledged by someone who isn't the deceased, thereby perpetuating their existence by memory alone.

<p>up:: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves _codified_" href="draft_idh3600-2nd-reflection-paper.html">DRAFT_IDH3600 - 2nd Reflection Paper</a>
</p>
<h4>Thesis</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>topic + claim (if you have one) + one point for each body paragraph
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nozick's objections to permanence as a quality of a meaningful life misinterpret Plato's concept of Forms.
</p>
<h4>Body</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>(three paragraphs) (Start each with a topic sentence that summarizes the main idea.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Topic Sentence I. Evaluating Nozick's argument</h5>
<h6>Main Point</h6>
<p>Nozick's main conclusion, that to become eternal a human must become unchangeable, is incorrect.
</p>
<h6>Support 1.</h6>
<p>If equating permeance to an idea, then it is false to say that ideas are unchangeable. Ideas do change. That is how they live on. They are subject to evolution which is linked to their survival. No idea, even the most hateful, hasn't been adapted by people to the times they lived in. It is because ideas <em>are</em> abstract that, just like people, are mutable. What people lose when becoming immortalized isn't the capacity to change but to change in their own terms. By becoming an abstract object, the cede control of this new form their lives has taken to those that remain in this world.
</p>
<h5>Topic Sentence II. In Support of Nozick's Argument</h5>
<h6>Main Point</h6>
<p>I agree with Nozick's criticism to permanence as the meaning of life, for in the Western sphere, such an endeavor can inflate the ego and encourage a single-minded pursuit of a result that cannot be measured by the individual.
</p>
<h6>Support 1.</h6>
<p>I am critical of such a pursuit of a meaningful life for what people are capable of doing with those that have become an abstract idea. Those that have been immortalized are commonly used for political purposes, some of which cared for only acquiring and holding onto power. By deifying a person, they paint them in a positive light, which by proxy of having them as a symbol, paints a political groups as good, leaving no room for criticism, change, nor improvement.
