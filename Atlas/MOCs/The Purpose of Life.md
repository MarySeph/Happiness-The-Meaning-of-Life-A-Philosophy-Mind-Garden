up:: [[Meaning of Life]]

# The Purpose of Life

A more theoretical approach to [[Meaning of Life]]. The "purpose" explores *reasons* of life. The "why."

Like, [[The Point in Life]], there will be a single entry. Unlike it, this author discusses humanity "as a whole."

[[Robert Nozick]] talks about a lot of things. Here, I want to focus on his perspective on [[Traces]]. In the [[DRAFT_IDH3600 - 2nd Reflection Paper|IDH3600 - 2ndReflectionPaper]], I was fascinated with the notion of humans who have caused a substantial effect in human history and culture become abstract beings. I think it would be interesting to explore in the realm of objectification and idolatry in social and political circles across history. The crux of my objection still stands. A human that has become concept can be manipulated by those who remain, reimagined, to serve their own purposes.
