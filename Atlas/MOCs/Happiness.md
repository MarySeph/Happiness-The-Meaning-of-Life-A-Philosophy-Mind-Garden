# Happiness

What is happiness? For philosophers, such a question that would otherwise be answered to introduce a topic would be concise and simple. There is not such thing here. So while I will not tell you the definition of happiness, I will share what philosophers since Ancient Greece till now have written about the topic.

There are two significant notions about this thing called happiness. One has a physical component, known as [[Well-being]] and the other simply called [[Psychological Happiness]]. That's pretty much it.

Happiness and meaning, in this case the [[Meaning of Life]] tend to intersect every so often. This connection occurs more often in [[Psychological Happiness]] theories were the proposed notion happiness rests on a "meaningful meaning of one's life or the human species", a can which holds a bunch of worms as you'll quickly see.

Something worth mentioning about the intersection between happiness and the meaning of life is historical sensitivity, for before the Enlightenment, religion had a vast influence on many populations, contrary to today's general agnostic socio-cultural alignment. Mostly because the Church had a lot of political power. Anyways, back to topic! 

In the past, pious and god-fearing peasant and aristocratic lives alike, people's lives had meaning because there was a higher who cared. The narrative was anthropocentric. Human were chosen by God. They were special. Their importance was established. Unshakable. Most importantly, it gave meaning to their suffering. 

One of the most interesting findings I had in this class was the ripple effect of "killing God." Never before has humanity depended on itself to forge its own path, and I cannot express how absolutely terrifying a realization that was. The weight of every choice was crushing, and there was no guide to light the path. There was no right and wrong. There were no absolutes. As a god-killer, it was like being sentences to drift through a desert like an exile from a home I never truly belonged to.
