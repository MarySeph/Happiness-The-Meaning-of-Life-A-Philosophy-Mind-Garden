# Well-being

The starting point, like many discussions in Western Philosophy, began with the Greeks. This Greek was, lo an behold, [[Aristoteles]]. His argument for "the good life" ([[Eudaimonia (εὐδαιμονία)]]) is as alive as a living dead, for the cultural sensitivity in which it was posed is long gone. [[The Function Argument]] is *key* to understand this view, and the subsequent ethical theory build on the seminal [[Nicomacean Ethics]]. I strongly oppose Aristoteles argument, for human life must not be reduced to a paying work. At least, not everyone's. Some people find fulfillment in their work, heck, I do, and thus I struggle because I need to keep a firm grasp on the [meaning](obsidian://open?vault=Happiness%20%26%20The%20Meaning%20of%20Life%2C%20A%20Philosophy%20Mind%20Garden&file=Atlas%2FMOCs%2FMeaning%20of%20Life) behind it. Furthermore, Aristoteles also claims that the key to a good life lies in reasoning because it's unique to humans which can be objected to in the grounds that it could be that other-than-human cannot be perceived because it's so vastly different from what humans except. A simpler objection would be scientific observations of various species like octopuses, birds, and primates which claim they possess a higher level of intelligence than previously thought.

The following are the main theories of well-being. These are [[Hedonism Theory of Well-Being]], [[Desire Fulfillment Theory]], and [[Objective List Theory]].
