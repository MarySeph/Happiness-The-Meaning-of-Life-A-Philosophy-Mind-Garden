# IDH3600 - Happiness & The Meaning of Life - 3rd Reflection Paper - Conclusion

It seems that the Paradox of Hedonism may be useful to advance discussions on the nature of pleasure as a measure of well-being. Devising different methods that result in pleasure and/or the reduction of pain is outside the scope of philosophy. However, hedonist theorists may benefit to further consider why pleasure is most successfully obtained through indirect means.
