# IDH3600 - Happiness & The Meaning of Life - 3rd Reflection Paper - Paragraph 1

Philosophical discourse on well-being stems from the question of what is 'good for' a person. In this paper, I will present the Hedonist theory of well-being, pose an objection, and reply to that objection.

The Hedonist Theory of well-being centers around the sensations of pleasure and pain, claiming that what's good for a person is seeking balance of both sensations across their life (Crisp, 2021). Under this theory, the sensation of pleasure is a measure of well-being, and the sensation of pain is a measure of ill-being. Thus, what *feels good* (pleasure) *is good* *for* a person.

Despite its apparent intuitiveness, this theory has been the subject of harsh criticism since its inception. Early objections rejected pleasure as a measure of, well *anything,* on the grounds that it belonged to beasts, and humans were above pleasure as a path towards ultimate happiness. Whereas the following objection aims to reveal the complexity of this seemly accessible theory.
