# IDH3600 - Happiness & The Meaning of Life - 2nd Reflection Paper - First Half

#### Introductory Paragraph
> (establish the topic so the reader knows enough to follow the paper.) 

"Ever-lasting", "immortalizing", "larger than life", these words evoke a feeling of grandiose. A romantic struggle to rise above the fragility and temporality of human existence to achieve something close to god(dess)hood. The narrative of rising above one's limitations is coated with admiration, hope, and other virtues. At its core it's the promise of immortality, at least among our peers, but a possibility of extending life longer than it's inevitable end nevertheless. Where did this value judgement originate, and what are its downsides?

#### Thesis
> topic + claim (if you have one) + one point for each body paragraph

In this paper, I will **explain the origin of the idea of the superiority of permanence, describe Nozick's objections against this idea, evaluate his argument, and offer my opinion on Nozick's argument.**

#### Body 
> (three paragraphs) (Start each with a topic sentence that summarizes the main idea.)

#####  Topic Sentence I. Permanence as a Quality of a Meaningful Life

###### Main Point 
The superiority of permanence dates back to Ancient Greece. Plato famously argued for entities called Forms which are eternal and unchanging (2022, Kraut).
###### Support 1.
These Forms were deemed superior to concrete objects because the latter eventually crumble into dust. Forms are another word for ideas, both concrete and abstract, such as a chair, Justice, Love, an apple, and so forth. These forms are immaterial which renders them indestructible. Because of this seemly immortal quality, they are superior to objects that can be sensed, death comes for all living things but the transmission of ideas and beliefs across generations keeps them alive. Since then, this value judgement has been applied to human existence, morphing into the belief that a meaningful life is one that leaves a significant trace in the world.

##### Topic Sentence II. Against Permanence (1)
###### Main Point
In the article "Philosophy and the Meaning of Life," Robert Nozick critiques this value judgement.


###### Support 1.
He hones into what entails to being eternal, becoming an idea; an abstract, unchangeable existence (2010, Benatar). Nozick believes this isn't the trace people want to leave. A trace that reflects the positive qualities of the individual which is tied to something they cared deeply about (2010, Benatar). For Nozick, becoming an idea means taking a snapshot of a person's life and freeze it for all eternity.

##### Topic Sentence III. Against Permanence (2)
###### Main Point
One way Nozick develops his objection is by critiquing funeral services.

###### Support 1.
Specifically, he argues about tombstones and funeral orators. On the former, he describes tombstones are memorials that prevent people from being forgotten. A marked tombstone indicates the life that is not more, an objective symbol of that person's existence. Until that tombstone breaks, crumbles, or becomes illegible, the person's existence can be acknowledged by someone who isn't the deceased, thereby perpetuating their existence by memory alone.
