# IDH3600 - Happiness & The Meaning of Life - 2nd Reflection Paper - Second Half

#### Thesis
> topic + claim (if you have one) + one point for each body paragraph

Nozick's objections to permanence as a quality of a meaningful life misinterpret Plato's concept of Forms.

#### Body 
> (three paragraphs) (Start each with a topic sentence that summarizes the main idea.)

#####  Topic Sentence I. Evaluating Nozick's argument

###### Main Point
Nozick's main conclusion, that to become eternal a human must become unchangeable, is incorrect.

###### Support 1.
If equating permeance to an idea, then it is false to say that ideas are unchangeable. Ideas do change. That is how they live on. They are subject to evolution which is linked to their survival. No idea, even the most hateful, hasn't been adapted by people to the times they lived in. It is because ideas *are* abstract that, just like people, are mutable. What people lose when becoming immortalized isn't the capacity to change but to change in their own terms. By becoming an abstract object, the cede control of this new form their lives has taken to those that remain in this world.

##### Topic Sentence II. In Support of Nozick's Argument

###### Main Point
I agree with Nozick's criticism to permanence as the meaning of life, for in the Western sphere, such an endeavor can inflate the ego and encourage a single-minded pursuit of a result that cannot be measured by the individual.

###### Support 1.
I am critical of such a pursuit of a meaningful life for what people are capable of doing with those that have become an abstract idea. Those that have been immortalized are commonly used for political purposes, some of which cared for only acquiring and holding onto power. By deifying a person, they paint them in a positive light, which by proxy of having them as a symbol, paints a political groups as good, leaving no room for criticism, change, nor improvement.
