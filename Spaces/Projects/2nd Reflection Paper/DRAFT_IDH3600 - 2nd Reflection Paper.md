# DRAFT_IDH3600 - 2nd Reflection Paper

> "It is difficult to discover why the more permanent is the more valuable or meaningful, why permanence or long-lastingness, why duration in itself, should be important" (56);
> Nozick is arguing against the view that permanence would make our lives meaningful.

- In roughly the first half of the paper, you should:  
    - **Explain the argument Nozick is arguing against.**
    - Explain Nozick's objections to that argument, and how that objection works.
    - Explain a further argument Nozick makes.  
        - You should include some textual evidence (in the form of quotations), and also explanations in your own words.
- In roughly the second half of the paper, you should:  
    - Evaluate Nozick's argument(s)—Pose an objection, explain how that objection works; if space allows, say whether and how that objection fails or succeeds. Can Nozick respond?
    - Tell me what you personally think and why—Do you agree with Nozick? Why or why not?
