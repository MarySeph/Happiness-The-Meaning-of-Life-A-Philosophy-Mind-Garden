# DRAFT_1st Reflection Paper
- In roughly the first half of the paper, you should:
	- Explain what Aristotle means by the "highest good."
	- Explain Aristotle's function argument.  
	- You should include some textual evidence (in the form of quotations from Aristotle), and also explanations from class and your own words.
- In roughly the second half of the paper, you should:
	- Evaluate Aristotle's function argument—Pose an objection to it, explain how that objection works; if space allows, say whether and how that objection fails or succeeds. Can Aristotle respond?
	- Tell me what you personally think and why—Do you agree with Aristotle? Why or why not?
